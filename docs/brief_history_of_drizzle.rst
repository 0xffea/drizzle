A Brief History Of Drizzle
=============

Drizzle was forked by Brian Aker in 2008 after the Sun Acqusition of MySQL
by Sun Microsystems. It was announced in 2008 at the O'Reilly Open Source
Conference. 

Drizzle came into being for both social and technical reasons.

On the technical side Drizzle is a micro-kernel design that is designed to
be as pluggable as possible. Anyone should be able to quickly extend the
database for whatever their needs are. Drizzle has been designed for modern
architectures and deployments. Drizzle does not shy away from breaking with
the past, many of the MySQL "Gotchas" have been removed.

Drizzle is open source software, designed in an organic manner by developers that span different companies. The development process has been geared to one more similar to the Linux Kernel where no single companies owns the source code, or provides all of the developers. In stark difference to MySQL, the goal is to be inclusive as possible and provide stable releases. The social charter of Drizzle encourages diversity and prize respectful dialogue between all participaing parties.

Drizzle today is the largest fork of the MySQL server. At the time writing, core developers span five companies, with as many, and sometimes more then, 30+
developers participating across different contents each month. Drizzle provides every other week releases and is the most well tested database in the MySQL family tree.
