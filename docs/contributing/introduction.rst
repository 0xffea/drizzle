Introduction
============

Drizzle's development primarily happens on
`Launchpad <http://launchpad.net/drizzle>`_ which handles code hosting, bugs,
mailing lists and everything else needed for project management.  You will need
a `Launchpad account <https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount>`_
before making most kinds of contributions.

One of Drizzle's aims is to have community contributions valued in the same way
as core developer contributions, and all code goes through exactly the same
approval and testing process no matter who it comes from (core developers or
general community).

There are many ways to contribute to Drizzle, for example:

 #. `File a bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/drizzle/+filebug>`_
 #. `Write translations <https://translations.launchpad.net/drizzle>`_
 #. :ref:`Write documentation <documentation-label>`
 #. :ref:`Write code <code-label>`

If you have any questions please contact us at 
`#drizzle <irc://irc.freenode.net/drizzle>`_
`Freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_ IRC channel or via. the
`Drizzle Discuss <https://launchpad.net/~drizzle-discuss>`_ mailing list.

Bazaar
------

Launchpad uses `Bazaar <https://launchpad.net/bazaar>`_ for revision control of
the source repositories, you will need this insalled before contributing
documentation or code.
