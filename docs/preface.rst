Welcome to Drizzle's official documentation. This community-generated resource covers what Drizzle is, the basics of the SQL language, and other advanced topics for Drizzle users. It has been written by the Drizzle developers and other volunteers in parallel to the development of the Drizzle software. In essence, it describes all the functionality that the current version of Drizzle officially supports.
