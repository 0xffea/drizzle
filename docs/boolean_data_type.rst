BOOLEAN Data Type
=================

BOOLEAN
-------

The ``BOOLEAN`` type works as a ``TRUE`` and ``FALSE`` type. 

A value of ``TRUE`` can be assigned to a ``BOOLEAN`` column by either assigning
``1``, ``TRUE``, ``"TRUE"``, ``"T"``, or ``"YES"``.

A value of ``FALSE`` can be assigned to a ``BOOLEAN`` column by either assigning
``0``, ``FALSE``, ``"FALSE"``, ``"F"``, or ``"NO"``.

Please note that using ``BOOL`` as a data type is different from using
``BOOLEAN`` as a type. ``BOOL`` creates an ``INTEGER`` column. This is done in
order to keep compatiblity with MySQL.
