IPV6 Data Type
==============

The data type IPV6 stores Internet Protocol version(IPv) 4 & 6 addresses. 

This data type is a 128-bit quantity that is generated by an algorithm designed to make it very unlikely that the same data type will be generated by anyone else in the world using the same algorithm. 

IPv6 address are written in preferred form as x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, where the 'x's are the hexadecimal values of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address separated by colons. Leading zeros in a group are allowed to be dropped, upper and lower case are equivalent. For example:

	 1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A  a unicast address
         FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101        a multicast address
         0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1             the loopback address
         0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0             the unspecified addresses

may be represented as:

         1080::8:800:200C:417A       a unicast address
         FF01::101                   a multicast address
         ::1                         the loopback address
         ::                          the unspecified addresses

The IPV6 data type support to store IPv4 address in specific format. 
For example:

::192.168.1.10

IPV6 are documented as part of Standard Track :rfc:'2373'.
