DATA_DICTIONARY
===============

The DATA_DICTIONARY is a Drizzle extension that provides information on the
state of the database, and on the definitions of tables and other objects.
If you wish to write portable tools you should make use of the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.

USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES

The table contains the name and value of the user defined variables that the user has created during the current session.
