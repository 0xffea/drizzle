What is Drizzle?
================

Drizzle is a micro-kernel designed database system with relational and
durability goals built into the kernel as a default design. It supports a
number of interfaces which are "pluggable" so that the kernel does as little
as possible. This allows users to extend the database by writing simple
plugins.

Drizzle supports SQL92, with custom extensions for advanced users.

It has been designed for modern environments which are 64bit, have lots of
cores, many gigs of memory, and where a database is needed that will fit into the infrastructure
of the environment (compared to classic solutions where the database is a
world unto itself).

Drizzle is open source software, and is maintained by a number of
individuals and companies for the better advancement of all who participate.
