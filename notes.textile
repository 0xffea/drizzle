h1. Andy's notes

All the functions in mystrings/ do this little "increment in the
loop and then decrement on the way out."  That's just silly.

Move my_compress() into libdrizzle/net_serv.c and throw away my_uncompress.

The const uchar *packet into net_real_write() is wrong.  We free
the packet, so it is not const.

Work on getting ccache running.
