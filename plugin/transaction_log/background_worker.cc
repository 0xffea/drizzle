/**
 * @file
 *
 * Defines the implementation of the background worker thread
 * which maintains summary information about transaction log.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * The general process that the background worker (collector) thread goes through
 * is the following:
 *
 * a) At thread start, we first check to see if there is an index
 *    file for the transaction log that has previously been written
 *    by the collector thread.  If there is, we read in the index and
 *    use that information to construct our in-memory index.
 *
 * b) If no index is around, we read the transaction log and create
 *    an in-memory index.  This in-memory index is sync'd to disk 
 *    every once in a while.  We don't care about crashes and the state
 *    of the index written to disk, since the transaction log file is
 *    the main stable state of the transaction log, not the index.
 *
 * c) Periodically, the collector thread queries the transaction
 *    log's current offset.  If this offset is greater than the last 
 *    offset in the collector's index, it reads a segment of the transaction
 *    log, building the index for the transactions it finds.
 *
 * d) When querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, or the replication system
 *    needs an exact read of the index, the collector thread is signalled
 *    via a pthread_cond_broadcast() call and the collector thread reads
 *    the transaction log up until the last log offset of the transaction log,
 *    building the index as it reads the log file.
