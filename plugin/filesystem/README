This is a demo for filesystem plugin. To make it work,
you have to put a file name 'demo.txt' in your deployment
directory.

Here's the corresponding example used in mysql-filesystem-engine.
drizzle> CREATE TABLE LoadAverage (
            load1 DECIMAL(3, 2), 
            load5 DECIMAL(3, 2), 
            load15 DECIMAL(3, 2), 
            active_processes VARCHAR(12), 
            lastpid INTEGER) ENGINE=FILESYSTEM;

drizzle> select * from LoadAverage;
+-------+-------+--------+------------------+---------+
| load1 | load5 | load15 | active_processes | lastpid |
+-------+-------+--------+------------------+---------+
|  0.00 |  0.00 |   0.00 | 1/97             |    6061 | 
+-------+-------+--------+------------------+---------+

NOTE: as right now, the file path can't be passed to storage engine
easily without modification to the parser. So this demo only uses
a static file put in your deployment directory.
