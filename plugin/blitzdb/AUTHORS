BLITZDB AUTHORS
---------------------------------------
Maintainer/Developer: Toru Maesaka

NOTES
---------------------------------------
Before BlitzDB, there was TokyoEngine which was an experimental
storage engine for MySQL. TokyoEngine was written by Brian Aker
and later ported to Drizzle by Stewart Smith.

Much of the basis was learnt from TokyoEngine and in many ways,
it is a successor project to TokyoEngine.

TOKYO CABINET
---------------------------------------
BlitzDB's low layer I/O is handled by Tokyo Cabinet.
Thanks to Mikio Hirabayashi for writing and open sourcing
this great database library.
