  Execute a BINLOG statement

  To execute the BINLOG command properly the server needs to know
  which format the BINLOG command's event is in.  Therefore, the first
  BINLOG statement seen must be a base64 encoding of the
  Format_description_log_event, as outputted by mysqlbinlog.  This
  Format_description_log_event is cached in
  rli->description_event_for_exec.
