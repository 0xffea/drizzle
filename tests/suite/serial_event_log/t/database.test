# Simple test of the serial event log for CREATE DATABASE and
# DROP DATABASE  
# 
# Create a database then drop a database 
# 
# We then use the transaction_reader in drizzled/message/ to read the events.
#

# CREATE DATABASE 
CREATE DATABASE test1;
DROP DATABASE test1;

# Read in the event.log.  We must cut out all the Timestamp: XXXXXX
# because they are not deterministic.
