  Return time in micro seconds

  SYNOPSIS
    my_micro_time()

  NOTES
    This function is to be used to measure performance in micro seconds.
    As it's not defined whats the start time for the clock, this function
    us only useful to measure time between two moments.

    For windows platforms we need the frequency value of the CUP. This is
    initalized in my_init.c through QueryPerformanceFrequency().

    If Windows platform doesn't support QueryPerformanceFrequency() we will
    obtain the time via GetClockCount, which only supports milliseconds.

  RETURN
    Value in microseconds from some undefined point in time

/*
  Return time in seconds and timer in microseconds (not different start!)

  SYNOPSIS
    my_micro_time_and_time()
    time_arg		Will be set to seconds since epoch (00:00:00 UTC,
                        January 1, 1970)

  NOTES
    This function is to be useful when we need both the time and microtime.
    For example in MySQL this is used to get the query time start of a query
    and to measure the time of a query (for the slow query log)

  IMPLEMENTATION
    Value of time is as in time() call.
    Value of microtime is same as my_micro_time(), which may be totally
    unrealated to time()

  RETURN
    Value in microseconds from some undefined point in time
