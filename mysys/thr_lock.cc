/*
Read and write locks for Posix threads. All tread must acquire
all locks it needs through thr_multi_lock() to avoid dead-locks.
A lock consists of a master lock (THR_LOCK), and lock instances
(THR_LOCK_DATA).
Any thread can have any number of lock instances (read and write:s) on
any lock. All lock instances must be freed.
Locks are prioritized according to:

The current lock types are:

TL_READ	 		# Low priority read
TL_READ_WITH_SHARED_LOCKS
TL_READ_HIGH_PRIORITY	# High priority read
TL_READ_NO_INSERT	# Read without concurrent inserts
TL_WRITE_ALLOW_WRITE	# Write lock that allows other writers
TL_WRITE_ALLOW_READ	# Write lock, but allow reading
TL_WRITE_CONCURRENT_INSERT
			# Insert that can be mixed when selects
TL_WRITE_DELAYED	# Used by delayed insert
			# Allows lower locks to take over
TL_WRITE_LOW_PRIORITY	# Low priority write
TL_WRITE		# High priority write
TL_WRITE_ONLY		# High priority write
			# Abort all new lock request with an error

Locks are prioritized according to:

WRITE_ALLOW_WRITE, WRITE_ALLOW_READ, WRITE_CONCURRENT_INSERT, WRITE_DELAYED,
WRITE_LOW_PRIORITY, READ, WRITE, READ_HIGH_PRIORITY and WRITE_ONLY

Locks in the same privilege level are scheduled in first-in-first-out order.

To allow concurrent read/writes locks, with 'WRITE_CONCURRENT_INSERT' one
should put a pointer to the following functions in the lock structure:
(If the pointer is zero (default), the function is not called)

check_status:
	 Before giving a lock of type TL_WRITE_CONCURRENT_INSERT,
         we check if this function exists and returns 0.
	 If not, then the lock is upgraded to TL_WRITE_LOCK
	 In MyISAM this is a simple check if the insert can be done
	 at the end of the datafile.
update_status:
	Before a write lock is released, this function is called.
	In MyISAM this functions updates the count and length of the datafile
get_status:
	When one gets a lock this functions is called.
	In MyISAM this stores the number of rows and size of the datafile
	for concurrent reads.

The lock algorithm allows one to have one TL_WRITE_ALLOW_READ,
TL_WRITE_CONCURRENT_INSERT or one TL_WRITE_DELAYED lock at the same time as
multiple read locks.

/*
  Downgrade a WRITE_* to a lower WRITE level
  SYNOPSIS
    thr_downgrade_write_lock()
    in_data                   Lock data of thread downgrading its lock
    new_lock_type             New write lock type
  RETURN VALUE
    NONE
  DESCRIPTION
    This can be used to downgrade a lock already owned. When the downgrade
    occurs also other waiters, both readers and writers can be allowed to
    start.
    The previous lock is often TL_WRITE_ONLY but can also be
    TL_WRITE and TL_WRITE_ALLOW_READ. The normal downgrade variants are
    TL_WRITE_ONLY => TL_WRITE_ALLOW_READ After a short exclusive lock
    TL_WRITE_ALLOW_READ => TL_WRITE_ALLOW_WRITE After discovering that the
    operation didn't need such a high lock.
    TL_WRITE_ONLY => TL_WRITE after a short exclusive lock while holding a
    write table lock
    TL_WRITE_ONLY => TL_WRITE_ALLOW_WRITE After a short exclusive lock after
    already earlier having dongraded lock to TL_WRITE_ALLOW_WRITE
    The implementation is conservative and rather don't start rather than
    go on unknown paths to start, the common cases are handled.

    NOTE:
    In its current implementation it is only allowed to downgrade from
    TL_WRITE_ONLY. In this case there are no waiters. Thus no wake up
    logic is required.
